<b> Machine Learning Classification Techniques on Imbalance Breast Cancer Dataset  </b>

In this project we are applying different machine learning algorithms on breast cancer dataset to classify 
the stage of cancer as malignant or benign depending on the features available in the dataset. Malignant stage is 
considered as harmful while benign means the earlier stage of cancer. 

The main aim of this project is to research if the model's performance is improved by handling the imbalance data.
Performed pre-processing steps on the dataset that includes dealing with missing values, detecting outliers by plotting boxplots, scaling the data if required and 
handling imbalance. Applied various Smote techniques - KMeans Smotes, Borderline Smote, SVM Smote to balance the data. Further, build models using machine learning algorithms and 
selects the best performing three classification algorithms and tune their corresponding hyperparameters.
